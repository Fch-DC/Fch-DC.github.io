        <p>The word mythology comes from the word myth.  A myth  is a legend that people tell that gets passed down  from generation to generation.  Mythology          is  a group of myths  that  certain people  told.  Greek mythology started in Greece.  Roman mythology started in Rome.  Egyptian mythology started in          Egypt. Here there is a page about  Greek mythology, Roman mythology, and Egyptian mythology.  In most myths there are Gods, monsters, Magic, and                demigods/heros. That's what makes them fun and interesting, so I hope you enjoy mythology. </p>
